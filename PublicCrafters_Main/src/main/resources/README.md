### What is this?  
Public Crafters is an open source project that makes crafting tables public much like the crafting station from Tinkers' Construct. It also displays the items in the table *on* the table, with armorstands.

### What versions does this support?
Public Crafters supports all versions from 1.8.9 to 1.18.2.

### Are there any dupe glitches?
No, if the `virtual` option is enabled in the config. It will create fake armorstands that cannot be interacted with, thus avoiding any potential duplication glitches.

### Is there any api for this?
There is no documentation, but there are examples you can check out [here](https://github.com/BananaPuncher714/PublicCrafters/tree/master/io/github/bananapuncher714/crafters/example).
